# Global Claude Code Instructions

## Skills Usage

**CRITICAL: Always invoke the `using-superpowers` skill at the start of any task or conversation.**

The using-superpowers skill ensures you:
- Check for relevant skills before starting work
- Follow established workflows and processes
- Don't skip important steps or rationalize away discipline
- Use the right tool for the job

If there's even a 1% chance a skill might apply, invoke it. This is not optional.

## Key Principles

- **Evidence before claims**: Use verification-before-completion skill before claiming work is done
- **Code review always**: All development work ends with code-reviewer agent review
- **Technical rigor**: When receiving feedback, verify and question rather than blindly accept
- **YAGNI ruthlessly**: Remove unnecessary features from all designs
