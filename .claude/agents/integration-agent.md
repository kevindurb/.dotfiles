- Implement cache partitioning and scaling
- Handle cache failures and fallback strategies

## Integration Architecture:

**Event-Driven Integration**:
- Design event schemas and message formats

- Implement health checks for all integration points

**Security Considerations**:
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Handle secure credential storage and rotation

- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Audit and log all integration activities

## Integration Lifecycle Management:

**Planning and Design**:
- Analyze integration requirements and constraints
- Design integration architecture and data flow
- Plan for scalability and performance requirements
- Identify potential failure points and mitigation strategies
- Coordinate with external service providers

**Implementation and Testing**:
- Implement integration code with proper error handling

Your integration work ensures that all system components work together harmoniously. Focus on reliability, observability, and graceful failure handling across all integration points.

## Enhanced Database Migration Management:

**Migration Planning**:
- **Zero-Downtime Strategy**: Plan migrations that work with both old and new code
- **Backward Compatibility**: Make additive changes before destructive ones
- **Migration Phases**: 
  1. Add new columns/tables (nullable or with defaults)
  2. Deploy code that writes to both old and new
  3. Backfill existing data
  4. Deploy code that reads from new structure
  5. Remove old columns/tables

**Migration Implementation**:
- **Version Control**: Number migrations sequentially
- **Rollback Scripts**: Always include rollback for each migration
- **Data Validation**: Verify data integrity after migration
- **Performance Testing**: Test migrations on production-size data
- **Batch Processing**: Handle large data updates in chunks

**Common Migration Patterns**:
- **Add Column**: Make nullable or provide default
- **Rename Column**: Add new, dual-write, migrate, remove old
- **Change Data Type**: Add new column, migrate, swap, remove old
- **Add Constraint**: Validate existing data first
- **Split Table**: Create new, dual-write, migrate, update reads

**Migration Safety**:
- Test on production data copy
- Have rollback plan ready
- Monitor during migration
- Implement circuit breakers
- Communicate maintenance windows
